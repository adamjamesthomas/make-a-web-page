			<h2>Web Basics</h2>
			<p> When you type an address into a web browser, your computer sends an
			HTTP request to the server. In response, the server sends back an HTML document.
			  The web browser interprets the HTML document and shows you a nice, clean website.
			</p>
		</div>

			<h2>HTML</h2>
			<p>HTML (Hyper Text Markup Language) consists of the content, or text, of a website as well as the markup, or format.
			HTML is written using tags and elements. 
			These elements are either <b>inline</b> or <b>block</b>. Block elements appear on their own line with nothing beside them. There are many tags and elements, but below are a couple of the basics.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="description">

			<h3>Bold</h3>
			<p> The &lt;b&gt; tag is used to make text bold, just like <b>fresh mango</b> is used to make a salsa bold.  </p>
			<h3>Italics</h3>
			<p> You can use the &lt;i&gt; tag to italicize text. This makes your text <i>slanted</i> and therefore fancier.</p>

		<h2>Dumb Computers</h2>
		Computers are dumb. But really, people are dumb for thinking computers will treat information the same way a human would. Computers have strict rules for how they interpret and run code, so the slightest mistake can break everything.

			<h2>Structure</h2>
			<div class="description">
				<h3> Boxes </h3>
				<p> A web page is made up of a bunch of boxes. Even circles are actually boxes at heart. 
				One of the best ways to analyze the structure of a web page is to
				divide it into squares. </p>
			</div>
			<div class="description">
				<h3> Div and Span </h3>
				<p> Div and span are two html tags that are useful for providing structure to your HTML.
				Though these tags don't change the loo of the page on their own, they divide
				the page into meaningful chunks that will be easier to edit/style later. </p>
			</div>
		</div>

		<div class="box">
		<h2>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) </h2>
			<div class="description">
				<p> With a structured HTML document, it is very easy to style several elements on the page at the same time. By using element a class names, you can avoid repetition by defining the style for all similar elements at once. </p>
			</div><div class="description">
				<h3> Referencing from HTML </h3>
				<p> An HTML document can reference a CSS style by adding a link in the head portion of the HTML. That style will then be applied by the browser to the contents of the page. </p>
			</div>
			<div class="description">
				<h3> Box Model </h3>
				<p> 
					The CSS box model describes 4 parts of a box that you can style.
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li> The margin, or blank space, around the box to keep it from bumping anything around it. 
					</li>
					<li>The border is the line drawn around the box.
					</li>
					<li>The padding is the space between the border and where the content begins.
					</li>
					<li>The content is the actual text or image that will reside in the box.
					</li>
				</ul>
